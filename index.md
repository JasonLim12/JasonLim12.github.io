Lab 2
   Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because it introduced me to the basics of c++. This is where I truly got to experience what it's like to use terminal and visual code. It laid a foundation for me to expand further out later on. I was also able to review the Fahrenheit to celsius conversion formulas.
 
Lab 4
   Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I felt like I actually knew everything I was doing. I was able to write all the code down with ease which was satisfying. I also didnâ€™t know about the Gregorian dates so it was a new learning experience.
 
Lab 7
   Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because it was very interesting for me to make a program to create my own sandwich. This is also when we first learned about vectors and arrays which is one of my favorite topics. With the use of arguments, we were able to determine which string was protein, condiment, and bread.
